<p id="tribute-info">Bud description
Gorilla Glue Autoâ€™s  buds will be chunky and dense, with a heavy resin production that causes your fingers to stick together like super glue. The buds are dark green, with swollen pointy calyx that swell wrapped in bright orange hairs. A truly impressive amount of trichomes that would make excellent cup winning extracts hands down.
Smoke report
She is one for smokers with the highest tolerances, and fans of sleepy indica Cannabis. Gorilla Glue Auto is extremely potent and her effects are not for the light hearted. Not only will she glue you to the nearest arm chair, your eyes and face will slowly feel the force of her physical effects. Certainly one for staying at home and lounging out with, for meditation, relieving stress, aches and pain, as well as inducing a heavy, long undisturbed sleep.
Plant Appearance
This lady likes to stay low and will usually grow to a height of 60-100 - up to 120cm, making her ideal for keeping out of sight. She does not require much maintenance and will reward you with massive yields of up to  450-600gr/m2. Her growth structure is short and bushy, thanks to her indica dominance and will grow one main central cola, with fat side branches all around. Once flowering starts, expect Gorilla Glue Auto to fill out thick and fast, as she begins to pack on size, weight and go crazy with the trichome output. From seed to harvest she is ready in 8-9 weeks, where she will finish with a short and fat appearance.
Grow Tips
Gorilla Glue Auto is a huge producer so it advised to add support around this strain, to help the side branches during the flowering stage. This lady is very resistant to plant disease and can withstand colder climates without suffering from mold or powdery mildew. She can take a big feed especially during week 3 and onwards. By tying her side branches down, this will increase the number of flowering sites and increase yields.This hybrid is able to withstand colder nighttime temperatures easily and will turn purple late into flowering. She reacts very well to pruning and will produce extra fat buds once flowering commences.
Flavor
A very refined piney citrus taste with a background of diesel and fuel. Her flavor becomes a mixture of gas and lemon that is emphasised even more on the exhale. Fans of Kush will soon have this strain in their top 3 when it comes to taste. </p>
